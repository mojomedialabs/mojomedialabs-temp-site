		<h2>Full Service Marketing Communications Agency Now Located in Las Colinas</h2>
		<p>IRVING, TX. &mdash; July 19, 2011 &mdash; A new name, new home and new way to do business. This is the case for <a href="http://mojomedialabs.com/">MOJO Media Labs</a>, formerly Rose Group Marketing, which made its debut May 27 in a new office in Las Colinas. The full service marketing communications agency was formerly located in Southlake, Texas.</p>
		<p>According to Michael Rose, CEO of MOJO Media Labs, the timing was not a coincidence, but a planned unveiling of the new agency, office, logo and website, as well as a refined business strategy aimed at making marketing easy.</p>
		<p>&quot;We are breaking the mold of traditional advertising agencies in more ways than one. By offering packaged services with fixed pricing, we are turning the agency model upside down and eliminating the confusion,&quot; Rose explains. &quot;We realize many business owners see marketing as a necessary evil. They know they need to do it, but perceive marketing as expensive, overwhelming and oftentimes a frustratingly long process. Our mission is to change that.&quot;</p>
		<p><img src="/images/press/mojo-media-labs-office.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; width: 300px;" />As a result, MOJO Media Labs has created a model that eliminates the proposal &quot;dance&quot; and delivers results quickly. The company is targeting small to medium-sized businesses that are growing fast and need professional marketing support to take it to the next level.</p>
		<p>&quot;Regardless of industry, companies in the 'adolescent stage' all face the same types of challenges. They are too small for a big agency to service cost effectively, but need a higher level than a freelancer can provide. MOJO Media Labs offers packaged services specifically designed to solve these challenges and speed-up the time to market,&quot; states Rose.</p>
		<p>Carl Thompson, recently named president of MOJO Media Labs and 22-year advertising industry veteran, developed the packages of services and deliverables aimed at meeting short-term goals critical to these businesses’ continued growth.</p>
		<p>&quot;Our packages reflect our team’s experience, knowledge and exposure to best practices to create the highest likelihood of success for our clients,&quot; Thompson says, noting the packages are designed for both cost efficiency and to enhance creativity. &quot;Too often, companies in this stage of business spend too much time in random acts of marketing by either working with an agency that is too big for their current budget or with a company that doesn’t fully understand the unique challenges of business in this stage of the lifecycle.&quot;</p>
		<p>MOJO Media Labs complements its packaged services with leadership skills and marketing expertise, guiding customers throughout the process, from on-boarding to final product roll-out.</p>
		<p>&quot;We like to think of ourselves as a business 'sherpa' for our clients,&quot; adds Thompson. &quot;Our team is comprised of aggressive, proactive thinkers and experienced leaders, who take a leadership position from day one. The smaller companies certainly need worker bees, but they really want and need big picture thinkers.&quot;</p>
		<p>As the name implies, MOJO Media Labs is not the typical marketing agency. Inspired by the M.I.T. Media Lab that is on the cutting edge of creating new forms of marketing communication platforms and leveraging emerging technology for commerce, MOJO Media Labs combines marketing and science.</p>
		<p>&quot;One of the primary reasons we decided to change the name was to reflect that our core competencies have moved way past the traditional advertising and marketing which used to play such a large role in our business,&quot; Thompson notes.</p>
		<p>In addition to MOJO Media Labs, the new office space also houses <a href="http://marketing-candy.com/">Marketing Candy</a> and <a href="http://rmichaelrose.com/">Return on Energy</a>&trade;, complementary divisions of the company. Implementing a vertical integration business model &mdash; which encompasses visions, strategy and tactics &mdash; the three divisions are able to combine resources and quickly take ideas to action. Services include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Advertising</li>
			<li>Branding</li>
			<li>Website design</li>
			<li>Mobile marketing</li>
			<li>Print materials</li>
			<li>Promotional products</li>
			<li>Public relations</li>

		</ul>
		<p>The 3,900 square foot new office, overlooking the canal in Las Colinas, has been transformed into a bright, flexible space designed to inspire creativity with orange walls, idea paint and a collaborative work environment, where talented freelancers come to work as projects arise.</p>
		<p>MOJO Media Labs is located in Canal Centre at 400 E. Las Colinas Boulevard, Suite 270, Irving, Texas 75039. For more information about the company’s services, call <a href="tel:972-815-1070">972-815-1070</a> or go to <a href="http://mojomedialabs.com/">mojomedialabs.com</a>.</p>
