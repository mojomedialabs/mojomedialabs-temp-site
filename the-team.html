			<h2>Kevin Giebler</h2>
			<h3>Creative Director</h3>
			<p><img src="/images/the_team/kevin-giebler.jpg" alt="Kevin Giebler" title="Kevin Giebler" />Not much is known about Kevin’s early days. Some say he was born in Kansas, others say that’s just where the spaceship crashed. His youth was spent primarily in his parent’s basement. He became interested in graphic design because of his love of album cover artwork from the 60's and 70's &mdash; among his favorites Captain Beefheart’s Trout Mask Replica. Look it up and you will get a sense of how disturbed he just might be. On the plus side, he is creative genius with a knack for getting it right the first time.</p>
			<p>He has a most likely forged diploma in Fine Arts from the University of Kansas and has been escorted out by security from some great jobs at some of the best design firms in Dallas.</p>
