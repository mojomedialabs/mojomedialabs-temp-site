	<h1>Avoid Random Acts of Marketing</h1>
	<p>If you’re only thinking about ROI, you’re missing half of the equation:</p>
	<p>Return on Investment (ROI) = The measure of the use of capital for profitability</p>
	<p>Return on Energy&trade; = The measure of the use of energy (human capital) for profitability</p>
	<p>Marketing Success = ROI + ROE ...  ROI - ROE = Random Acts of Marketing</p>
	<p>We believe the concept of ROI is incomplete; more goes into your marketing efforts than the money in your marketing budget. The energy spent choosing a marketing strategy and analyzing results often escape the ROI calculation.</p>
	<p>We've created a better way to look at your overall marketing strategy. Our subtle improvements in the way you approach marketing have as much impact on the bottom line (and on morale) as the actual marketing services we provide.</p>
